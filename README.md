# EVM-Design
Design of Electric Voting Machine (EVM). 
Sub Parts: 
1. To understand the social and political requirements of an EVM design: correctness, tamper proof guarantees, coercion free etc.
2. Work out a formal specification of an EVM design based on the requirements. 
3. Work out a functional design and verify the correctness against specification using some formal techniques.

This case study analysis the current Public Distribution System(PDS), works out a detailed requirement specification for effective PDS and also proposes a functional design for the same. 

Several possibilities of evaluating the designs using formal techniques are also explored in the process.
